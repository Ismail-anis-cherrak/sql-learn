   - Courses
     - Mathematics, 3
     - Physics, 4
     - Chemistry, 3
   - Enrollments
     - StudentID of John and CourseID of Mathematics, 2024-01-01
     - StudentID of Jane and CourseID of Physics, 2024-01-01
     - StudentID of Alice and CourseID of Chemistry, 2024-01-01

4. Update John Doe's email to john.doe.new@school.com.

5. Delete Jane Smith's enrollment in Physics.

6. Select and display all records from the Students, Courses, and Enrollments tables.
